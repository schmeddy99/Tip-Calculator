# Tip Calculator

## Description
This is a simple Python-based tip calculator that helps users split a bill among multiple people while including a tip. The program prompts the user to input the total bill amount, the percentage of tip they would like to give, and the number of people splitting the bill. It then calculates the total amount each person should pay and displays the result.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the total bill amount.
- Allows users to specify a tip percentage (10, 12, or 15).
- Splits the total amount, including the tip, among the specified number of people.
- Displays the final amount each person should pay, rounded to two decimal places.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the total bill amount when prompted.
3. Choose a tip percentage (10, 12, or 15).
4. Enter the number of people splitting the bill.
5. The program will display the amount each person should pay.
